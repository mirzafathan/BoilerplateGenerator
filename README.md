# BoilerplateGenerator

1. To generate boilerplates, run a command with the following format on your terminal
```console
python generate.py [boilerplate project] [pytorch model directory] ...
```
For example,
```console
python generate.py image_segmentation ./wave2vec2.pt
```

2. To see available options, run
```console
python generate.py -h
```

If `python` command doesn't work try `python3` or others.
